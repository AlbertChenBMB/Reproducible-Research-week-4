## Storm data analysis

This is an analysis report of storm data.
There are two questions we want to analyze, they are:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

***
In this report, there are three parts of chapter, first is Data Processing, second is Results, and third is summary.
***
## Data Processing

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
