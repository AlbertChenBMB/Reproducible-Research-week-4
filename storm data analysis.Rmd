## Storm data analysis

This is an analysis report of storm data.
There are two questions we want to analyze, they are:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

***
In this report, there are four parts of chapter, first is Synopsis, second is Data Processing, third is Results, and fourth is summary.

## Synopsis




## Data Processing

Firstly, we read the data from the original bz2 file and access it into a dataset named "rawStorm".
```{r}
rawStorm <- read.csv("repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2",encoding = "UTF-8",quote = "")
```
The rawStorm data containt with 37 variables and 1773320 objects.   
Because we have two different questions to analyze, so we split the data into two data sets which contain with different variables.
to find out most harmful with respect to population health, we need to analysis fatalities and injuries.
to find out the greatest economic consequences, we need to analysis property damage and crop damage.


```{r}
harmful_with_health<-rawStorm [,c("X.EVTYPE.","X.FATALITIES.","X.INJURIES.")]
cost_of_economic<-rawStorm [,c("X.EVTYPE.", "X.PROPDMG.","X.CROPDMG.")]

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
